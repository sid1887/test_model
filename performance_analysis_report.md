### 4. Web Scraping ❌ **CRITICAL FAILURE**

**Critical Issues:**
- 100% failure rate (0/5 successful)
- All requests returned HTTP 503 errors
- Service unavailable or rate limiting issues
- Complete breakdown of price comparison functionality

**Impact:**
- Core web scraping functionality non-operational
- No price data collection possible
- Real-time comparison features offline

## Root Cause Analysis

### Web Scraping Failures
1. **HTTP 503 Errors**: Service unavailable responses suggest:
   - Server overload or maintenance
   - Rate limiting by target websites
   - Anti-bot protection triggering
   - Backend scraping service offline

2. **Text Search Empty Results**: 
   - Database may be empty or test products not indexed
   - Search algorithm may need tuning
   - Product matching logic requires refinement

3. **Timeout Issues**: 
   - Some text searches exceed 10-second timeout
   - Possible database performance issues
   - Need for query optimization

## System Architecture Strengths

### AI/ML Pipeline Excellence
- **CLIP Model**: Performing exceptionally well with accurate similarity scoring
- **Image Processing**: Robust upload and analysis workflow
- **Database Integration**: Proper product indexing and retrieval
- **API Architecture**: Well-structured FastAPI implementation

### Performance Characteristics
- **Consistent Response Times**: Most operations complete within 2-3 seconds
- **Reliable Image Processing**: 100% success rate indicates robust pipeline
- **Proper Error Handling**: Timeout and error states properly managed
